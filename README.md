# 1D-Barcode-Detection
This project implements a robust method for detecting and matching 1D barcodes in im- ages image processing techniques. It combines feature extraction, morphological operations, and advanced matching algorithms such as Euclidean Distance and Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) for effective barcode detection and recognition.
